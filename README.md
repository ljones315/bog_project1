# The perfect Pokedex

If you've made it to this repo, congrats! You're in for a treat.
This Pokedex can tell you all about the original Gen-1 Pokemon (and some newer ones if you know the secret password)

In order to interact with the Pokedex, type in the name or ID of the Pokemon you'd like to research, then press enter

This will display all of the pokemon's stats!
To find more information, try pressing the location, evolution and moves buttons
If you're looking to browse, I recommend using the arrow buttons (or your l/r arrow keys)

Thanks for stopping by!
